## Covid-19 Vaccination Sentiment on Twitter

### Problem

Our hypothesis is that sentiment toward the Covid-19 vaccination program has been improving over the months since the announcement of the vaccine and FDA Emergency Use Authorization approvals of the first three vaccines. 
By analyzing tweets by keyword and utlizing sentiment anaylysis, we will deploy an app that will allow users to choose a date, or range of dates, to gain an understanding of the changing nature of the U.S.-based Twitter users attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccines.

### Process

1. Create a tool for performing sentiment analysis (Jupyter notebook)
1. Capture tweets dating back to July 1, 2020 that fit the following characteristics:
  1. U.S.-based Twitter users
  1. Tweets include any of a set of keywords related to Covid-19 vaccines
1. Build a Postgres SQL database for storing the downloaded tweets
1. Create a webpage, using Bootstrap, to house the app
1. Utilize Tabelau to visualize the data, embed Tableau notebooks into the webpage
1. Complete an analysis/postmortem of our project
1. Deploy the project
1. Prepare to present findings through a 15-minute presentation

### Tools utilized
1. Pandas
2. CSS/Boostrap
3. Postgres SQL database
4. Tableau
